# MigrateSubreddits
A python script for migrating subscribed subreddits to a new reddit account. I decided to put it on github, because why not.

USAGE
-----

Replace "from" in config.txt with the user account you wish to migrate from, replace "to" in config.txt with the user account
you wish to migrate to.

Then simply run the script. Remember to install praw.
